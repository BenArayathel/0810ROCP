# Core Java Evaluation - Revature

## Description

Revature is building a new API! This API contains methods for validating data, 
solving problems, and encoding data. The API consists of 20 methods that you 
must implement:

## Requirements
* Git
* GitHub Account
* IDE/Text Editor

Your trainer will pass out a link for assignments, projects, and coding challenges. When clicked on for the first time, you will be asked to login with your GitHub credentials, choose your name from a class roster, and accept the assignment. You will also receive an email inviting you to the classroom organization as a future collaborator. Once you have accepted the assignment, a repository with the naming convention [assignment-name]-[your-user-name] will be created on the organization containing instructions and starter code.

Open a terminal shell or git-scm terminal and clone the repository to your computer using the Git command:
	
	git clone https://github.com/[OrganizationName]/[RepositoryName].git

Next, open the project with your preferred text editor or IDE and complete the assignment according to your trainer’s instructions or Readme. When you are ready to submit your assignment, add, commit, and push your changes using the git commands:

```
	git add .
	git commit -m “Assignment Completed”
	git push
```

Be sure not to alter the folder structure, configuration files, or unit tests of the assignment unless specifically told to do so by your trainer. Be aware of any deadlines set by the trainer, and push your code beforehand.
